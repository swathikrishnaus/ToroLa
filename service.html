                                                Business analysis is used to identify and articulate the need for change in
                                                how organizations work, and to facilitate that change. As business analysts,
                                                we identify and define the solutions that will maximize the value delivered
                                                by an organization to its stakeholders. Business analysts work across all
                                                levels of an organization and may be involved in everything from defining

                                                Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an attempt
                                                to time the market. The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term
                                                market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock
                                                traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout
                                                the day . Stock markets are among the largest avenues for investments. There are
                                                primarily two stock exchanges in India, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the
                                                National Stock Exchange (NSE). Companies list their shares for the first time on
                                                a stock exchange through an IPO. Investors may then trade in these shares through
                                                the secondary market. The two stock exchanges in India have on some occasions
                                                witnessed stocks worth INR 6,00,000 crores being traded. The uninitiated in India
                                                often consider investing in stocks markets gambling, but a basic understanding of
                                                the share market can change that perception.

                                                come together to fund various portions of the loan asked by a single borrower. The
                                                process is majorly done when the amount is very large for a single lender or when
                                                the risk exposure levels are quite high. Therefore, multiple lenders form an
                                                association or syndicate to fund the requested capital. The borrower can be
                                                a corporate entity, government or an individual project. In corporate financing,
                                                loan syndication process is often used for diverse business reasons like project
                                                financing, mergers, acquisitions, buyouts, etc. where huge amount of capital is
                                                required and is normally outside the resource capacity of a single lender. Each
                                                lenderâ€™s liability/rights is only limited to the amount of their share of the
                                                total loan amount.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In the process of loan syndication, one lender acts as a manager or arranging
                                                bank on the behalf of other lenders who administers the loan. The agreements
                                                between the lenders and borrower require the services of a corporate risk manager
                                                to enforce contractual obligations and avoid misunderstandings. The primary
                                                lender generally conducts major due diligence (checking of historical financial
                                                records and dictate assessment of credit facilities) before entering into the syndication process.

                                                advertising, the techniques and practices used to bring products, services, opinions,
                                                or causes to public notice for the purpose of persuading the public to respond in a
                                                certain way toward what is advertised. Most advertising involves promoting a good
                                                that is for sale, but similar methods are used to encourage people to drive safely,
                                                to support various charities, or to vote for political candidates, among many other
                                                examples. In many countries advertising is the most important source of income for
                                                the media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, or television stations) through which it is
                                                conducted. In the noncommunist world advertising has become a large and important service industry.
                                                <br><br>
                                                In the ancient and medieval world such advertising as existed was conducted by word of mouth.
                                                The first step toward modern advertising came with the development of printing in the
                                                15th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century weekly newspapers in London began to
                                                carry advertisements, and by the 18th century such advertising was flourishing.

                                            <p class="text-justify">marketing, the sum of activities involved in directing the flow of
                                                goods and services from producers to consumers.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Marketingâ€™s principal function is to promote and facilitate exchange. Through marketing,
                                                individuals and groups obtain what they need and want by exchanging products and services
                                                with other parties. Such a process can occur only when there are at least two parties,
                                                each of whom has something to offer. In addition, exchange cannot occur unless the parties
                                                are able to communicate about and to deliver what they offer. Marketing is not a coercive
                                                process: all parties must be free to accept or reject what others are offering. So defined,
                                                marketing is distinguished from other modes of obtaining desired goods, such as through
                                                self-production, begging, theft, or force.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Marketing is not confined to any particular type of economy, because goods must be exchanged
                                                and therefore marketed in all economies and societies except perhaps in the most primitive.
                                                Furthermore, marketing is not a function that is limited to profit-oriented business; even such
                                                public institutions as hospitals, schools, and museums engage in some forms of marketing.
                                                Within the broad scope of marketing, merchandising is concerned more specifically with
                                                promoting the sale of goods and services to consumers (i.e., retailing) and hence is more
                                                characteristic of free-market economies.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Based on these criteria, marketing can take a variety of forms: it can be a set of functions,
                                                a department within an organization, a managerial process, a managerial philosophy, and a
                                                social process.

                                                A sales promotion is a marketing strategy in which a business uses a temporary campaign
                                                or offer to increase interest or demand in its product or service.There are many reasons
                                                why a business may choose to use a sales promotion (or â€˜promoâ€™), but the primary reason
                                                is to boost sales. Sales boosts may be needed to reach a quota as a deadline approaches,
                                                or to raise awareness of a new product.Letâ€™s take a closer look at different types of sales
                                                promotions, as well as the pros and cons of using any type of promotion.
